                <h3>* Determine your cleaning needs</h3>
                <p>First, think about what needs to be cleaned in your home. Each part-time cleaner offers different services. Some will clean floors and counters. Others might wash windows or do laundry for you.</p>
                <h3>* Decide on what tasks you need help with</h3>
                <p>Next, consider how often you want the cleaner to come. You may want a deep clean once a week or just light cleaning every day. This depends on how big your house is and how much dirt builds up each day. Some families with pets or young kids may need more frequent cleaning than others.</p>
                <h3>* Check for insurance and certifications</h3>
                <p>Make sure your chosen cleaner has insurance. This keeps you safe if there’s an accident while they work. Also, look out for cleaners with certifications. It shows they know how to do their job well from the right training.</p>
                <h3>* Read reviews and testimonials</h3>
                <p>It is smart to look at what other people say about a cleaner. Reviews and testimonials tell you if the cleaner does a good job. People write these after they have had their homes cleaned.</p>
                <p>They share what they liked and did not like about the service. Many people in Singapore used the cleaners on our list and loved them! You can trust these services because of these good reviews.</p>
                <h3>* Consider pricing and payment options</h3>
                <p>You should think about how much you can pay for a cleaner. In Singapore, part-time cleaners tend to charge around $25 per hour. They usually ask that you book them for blocks of three or four hours at once.</p>
                <p>So, a typical cost might be $75 to $100 each week. If you use the service every month it could come to $300 to $400 total. Some cleaning companies offer packages too. One common deal is getting cleaned one time weekly for three hours which would roughly cost around $359 monthly. Another choice is four times monthly with each clean being an hour long costing about $272 in total.</p>
                <p>So, look into different price deals and see what fits your budget best! You also need to think about how you will make payments as some services let you pay online, others may prefer cash on collection.</p>
                <h3>* Communication and reliability</h3>
                <p>Good communication is vital when hiring a part-time cleaner. Ensure your cleaner can listen well to understand your needs. This may include the tasks and how you want them done. It’s also important they respond fast if you have questions or concerns.</p>
                <p>Reliability goes hand in hand with good service. Your cleaner should be honest, turn up on time, and meet all agreed duties. A reliable cleaner will not cause stress about missed tasks or late arrivals.</p>
